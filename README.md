### Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The goal of this project was to develop a simple binding system in pwf, inspired by declarative frontent frameworks.

Implemented are:
- [`Window`](/src/Primitives/Window.cs) - A window whose title and icon are stripped using Win32 api `uxtheme.dll`, providing a clean look
- [`Component`](/src/Primitives/Component.cs) - A Simple component abstraction, provding binding capabilities which are generated using `PropertyChanged.Fody`
- [`Sample View`](/src/Views/ViewA.xaml.cs) - The main view of the application. It inherits the aforementioned `Component`.
- [`Main Window`](/src/MainWindow.xaml.cs) - Views can be dynamically swapped using the `CurrentView` preopery of type `Component`
- [`Logo Track`](/src/Components/LogoTrack.xaml) - Demonstrates how to encapsulate a specific component. Also exposes "props" (Dependency Properties) using the `[Bind]` attribute found in `Kasay.DependencyProperty.WPF.Fody`
